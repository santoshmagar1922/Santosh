Santosh(Github name) repository is a sample project which demos the implementation and use of spring mvc and Spring REST API with jsp and angular js technologies. This project provides some functionalities like creating a company, updating it, getting details of a company and listing all companies from DB. Angular js is used as main scripting framework and bootstrap is used for UI stying. Spring REST is used as API for server side. Instead of DB, we used static objects which will hold the data instead of  DB.
